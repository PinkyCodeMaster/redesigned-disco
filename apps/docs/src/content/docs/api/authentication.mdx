# API Authentication

This guide explains how to authenticate with the Athena API, covering methods like JWT, session management, and the necessary steps for secure access to your Athena services.

## Authentication Overview

Athena uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authenticating API requests. Once a user is authenticated, a token is issued and should be included in subsequent API requests.

## Getting Started with Authentication

1. **Create an Account**: Before authenticating via the API, you'll need to create an account. This can be done using the `/auth/register` endpoint, where you'll provide your username, email, and password.

2. **Login**: To authenticate, you need to log in via the `/auth/login` endpoint by providing your username/email and password.

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-api.com/auth/login \
   -d '{"username": "user", "password": "yourpassword"}' \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json"
